# BlueHub_GUI
NCKU course crawler.

## Features
* Search the course information.
* Schedule the searching list.
* Send email to notify the user when the course is not full.

## Version
### **`2.0`**
Afer the NCKU course web had been upgrated, the original version of BlueHub couldn't work any more. I tried to use basic get/post methods to get the information of web, but it's difficult because the form-data was encrypted. So I use [**selenium**](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/)--- a slower, but more powerful tool to get what I want. It probably takes 10 seconds to obtain the html of web.
